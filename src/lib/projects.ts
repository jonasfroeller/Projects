        description: `"jonasfroeller" is my personal website, that I created to show off
        my skills and interests. My name is Jonas, and I am a 17-year-old
        student currently studying at HTBLA Leonding in Austria. I am
        pursuing a field of study in IT/Mediatechnology, and I have a keen
        interest in programming, especially web development. Aside from my
        native language, German, I am also fluent in English, with a B+
        level of proficiency. I have experience working with various
        programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Java, ShellScript,
        JavaScript & NodeJS, PHP, and MySQL & Oracle SQL. Recently, I have
        discovered the Svelte JS-framework and learned Svelte along with
        SvelteKit. I have also gained expertise in working with TailwindCSS.
        This Portfolio is built with DaisyUI & TailwindCSS and statically
        hosted on Netlify & GitHub, hosted with NodeJS on Vercel.`,
